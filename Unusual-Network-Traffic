# Privileged Escalation Detection

### Use Case Overview
This rule detects unauthorized privilege escalation by monitoring changes to user group memberships, specifically when a user is added to an administrative group such as "Domain Admins" or "Administrators" (Event ID 4732). Unauthorized privilege escalation can be an indicator of a compromised account or insider threat activity.

### Query
The following Splunk query captures events where a user is added to a privileged group:

```splunk
(source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4732) 
| search "TargetGroupName=Administrators" OR "TargetGroupName=Domain Admins"
```

# How It Works
This query gathers logs from network security devices (firewalls, proxies) or Windows event logs and aggregates the total amount of data sent (bytes_sent) from internal IP addresses to external destinations. It then checks if the data volume exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 1MB) and whether the destination IP is known to be suspicious or abnormal. This helps detect possible data exfiltration attempts to malicious actors or untrusted locations.

# Response Actions
- Verify if the destination IP is legitimate and authorized for data transfer.
- Investigate the source IP for signs of compromise or unauthorized data access.
- Isolate the endpoint if the traffic is deemed suspicious.
- Block or throttle further data transfers to the destination IP.
- Trigger alerts or an automated SOAR workflow to respond to the potential exfiltration.


### Key Highlights:
- **Threshold**: You can adjust the `total_bytes` threshold based on what is considered unusually large data transfer in your environment.
- **Suspicious IP List**: Maintain a list of known malicious IPs or unapproved external destinations to monitor effectively.

This use case demonstrates the detection logic for unusual network activity and potential data exfiltration, giving a clear understanding of how to capture outbound traffic for further analysis and response.
