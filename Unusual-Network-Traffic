# Privileged Escalation Detection

### Use Case Overview
This rule detects unauthorized privilege escalation by monitoring changes to user group memberships, specifically when a user is added to an administrative group such as "Domain Admins" or "Administrators" (Event ID 4732). Unauthorized privilege escalation can be an indicator of a compromised account or insider threat activity.

### Query
The following Splunk query captures events where a user is added to a privileged group:

```splunk
(source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4732) 
| search "TargetGroupName=Administrators" OR "TargetGroupName=Domain Admins"
