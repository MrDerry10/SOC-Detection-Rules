# Brute-Force Login Detection

### Use Case Overview
This rule detects brute-force login attempts by monitoring multiple failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) followed by a successful login (Event ID 4624) from the same source within a 5-minute window.

### Query
The following Splunk query captures the failed and successful login events:

```splunk
(source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625) 
| stats count by src_ip, user 
| where count > 5 
| append [search (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4624) | stats count by src_ip, user] 
| where src_ip = src_ip AND user = user ```
